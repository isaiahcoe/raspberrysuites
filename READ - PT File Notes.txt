This project was created to show case my skills at configuring Cisco network devices. 

I have removed all my notes from the public verison of packet tracer file. Potential employers
may request source file for review. 

The following have been configured: 
- IPv4 Addressing
- OSPF
- Vlans 
- VTP 
- Spanning-Tree 
- DHCP Server 
- DNS Server 
- Router On A Stick 
- L3 Switch Routing
- EtherChannel 
- Limited ACL Config

The following have not been configured due to time constraints: 
- Usernames/Passwords
- Telnet/SSH
- SNMP 
- Serial Cables 
- WLC (Buggy in Packet Tracer) 

The following will be configured in the future: 
- Secure ACL config 
- IPv6 Addressing
- Voice Vlan for IP phones 
- Physical Firewalls
- Port Security 
- Network Controller 
- BGP on ISP Router 

Thanks for reading,
