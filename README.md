If all goes well, they plan on be expanding to up to 10 hotels in the next 5 years. You have been tasked to design the initial network mockup for the first hostel. Raspberry Suites 1 will have 50 guest rooms, a staff area, indoor pool, conference/dining hall, and a kitchen. There must be internet access through-out the entire building and their parking lot. They will have a fiber optic and copper main/service line into the networking room. You have been tasked to create provide the initial network plans, estimates, and service level agreement.
